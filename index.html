                <p>At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as <code>=</code> and <code>+</code>.</p>
                <p>The following are some common operators:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignment operators</li>
                    <li>Comparison operators</li>
                    <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
                    <li>Bitwise operators</li>
                    <li>Logical operators</li>
                    <li>BigInt operators</li>
                    <li>String operators</li>
                    <li>Conditional (ternary) operator</li>
                    <li>Comma operator</li>
                    <li>Unary operators</li>

                <header>Regular expression</header>
                <p>Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects.</p>
                <p>These patterns are used with the <code>exec()</code> and <code>test()</code> methods of <code>RegExp</code>, and with the <code>match()</code>, <code>matchAll()</code>, <code>replace()</code>, <code>replaceAll()</code>, <code>search()</code>, and <code>split()</code> methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.</p>

                <header>Working with object</header>
                <p>Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.</p>
                <p>Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>

                <header>Using classes</header>
                <p>JavaScript is a prototype-based language — an object's behaviors are specified by its own properties and its prototype's properties. However, with the addition of classes, the creation of hierarchies of objects and the inheritance of properties and their values are much more in line with other object-oriented languages such as Java.</p>
                <p>In many other languages, classes, or constructors, are clearly distinguished from objects, or instances. In JavaScript, classes are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism — all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance.</p>
                <p>Classes themselves are normal JavaScript values as well, and have their own prototype chains. In fact, most plain JavaScript functions can be used as constructors — you use the <code>new</code> operator with a constructor function to create a new object.</p>
